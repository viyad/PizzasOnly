## The web-application, an ordering form, is created based on the client’s, PizzasOnly, requirements. It works on Google Chrome. The ordering form takes one input from a user through an input textbox in their web browser. The input is validated using JavaScript. The JavaScript interacts with the HTML form using Document Object Model (DOM) to inform the user of the validation process whether the input is valid or invalid.
